How would you approach the testing of roulette?

Since i clearly do not have a requirement documents, i intend to use an exploratory approach of testing.
I explored the webapp by interacting with it, trying out different features, then observing its behavior to simply underatnd the logic
of the intended funtinality of each module.
I also intend to test the funtionality of the most important CTA(call to action) button a user would typically use.

I would particullay pay attention to {LANGUAGE}, {WITHDRAWAL}, {DEPOSIT}. {SIGNIN} and {ABOUT}


Describe the tests that you would do and the things you'd pay attention to?
I would pay more attention to functionality and performance and ofcourse the responsiveness 
I would also look into the general usabilty of the app by manual testing.



Describe the tests that you would?
Automated Funtionality test- to assert the visibilty and functionality of some CTA, dialogue boxes and search buttons(if any)
Performance test- just to check the speed and latency time in which the page loads with all elements â€“ text, images, etc.
Cross browser testing- to check whether teh website can be accessed through different browers and different device 

##def test_input(page: Page) -> None:
    page.goto("/")
    page.click("text=Deposit")
    page.click("text=CS:GO")
